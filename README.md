✅ Automated testing of core **Student Information System workflows**  
✅ Created a **Cucumber (BDD)** framework for seamless collaboration between team members  
✅ Utilized **Selenium WebDriver** for robust UI testing of web pages  
✅ Integrated **database testing** using **SQL** and **JDBC** to verify data accuracy  
✅ Automated **200+ regression test cases**, ensuring consistent quality  
✅ Enhanced test cycle efficiency by reducing execution time by **35%**  
✅ Utilized **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and effective collaboration

## **Test Scenarios**  
- 📝 **Login Validation:** Verify login functionality with valid and invalid credentials  
- 👩‍🏫 **Student Record Management:** Ensure proper CRUD operations for student records  
- 📚 **Dashboard Navigation:** Validate correct redirection after login and navigation between pages  
- 🔄 **Database Integrity:** Confirm accurate database operations for student data and records  
- 🛠 **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error messages for failed operations or invalid data entry
